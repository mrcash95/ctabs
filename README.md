# CTabs
This is a Google Chrome extension inspired by the TabShots extension ( https://www.securitee.org/files/tabnabbing_asiaccs2013.pdf ), 
to combat Tabnabbing attack. I would like to add few features in this extension:

(1)Pop out notification (prompt box) if the result from the page comparing is over 10%

(2)Offer to blacklist the website through the pop out notification. For the blacklisting , I would like to borrow the source codes from https://github.com/rahulgi/Blacklist 

(3)Generate a brief report in the next tab that comprised of:
  
  (a)Page/site tested URL
  
  (b)Severity score
  
  (c)Action taken: Blacklisted/ Not Blacklisted

In short, this is the enhancement version of TabShots.
